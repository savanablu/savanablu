Zanzibar has a handful of "famous" excursions — Safari Blue, Prison Island, spice experiences, Jozani Forest, Mnemba reef. The reality is that not every experience suits every traveller, and not every operator runs them in the same way.

At Savana Blu, we design days the way a boutique lodge plans a game drive: small groups, careful timing and guides who know when to step back. Here's how to choose.

## Start with how you like to travel

Before listing experiences, think about **how you like to spend a day**:

- Do you prefer to be on the water or on land?

- Are you happiest roaming markets and backstreets, or on a sandbank with your feet in the water?

- Do you enjoy early starts, or do you move slowly in the morning?

Your answers shape whether we tilt your time more towards **Stone Town, spice and forest**, or towards **reefs, sandbanks and sunset coasts**.

## The essential experiences, curated

### 1. Stone Town: stories, markets and sunsets

A good Stone Town walk is not a checklist of buildings; it's a **conversation with the city**.

We recommend:

- A **morning heritage walk** when streets are quieter.

- A pause in the **market and fish section**, with context — not just quick photos.

- Ending with a rooftop drink, or Forodhani Garden snacks at dusk.

If you like layered stories and street life, one deep Stone Town morning is worth more than three rushed experiences.

### 2. Spice & village life

Spice experiences can feel staged if you visit the wrong place. We prefer small farms where:

- Groups are genuinely small.

- Hosts talk about **how spices are used at home**, not just their Latin names.

- There's time to sit, taste and ask questions.

Combine this with a simple **village walk** and you see a little of daily life beyond the brochure.

### 3. Ocean days: Safari Blue & Mnemba

For ocean lovers, two experiences stand out:

- **Safari Blue** — a full day on a traditional dhow with snorkelling, sandbank time and grilled seafood.

- **Mnemba reef** – iconic coral gardens and a chance (never a guarantee) to see dolphins.

The Savana Blu difference is in the detail: which days we go, which crew we use, and how we time our sandbank stops to avoid the worst of the crowds.

### 4. Jozani Forest & the south coast

Jozani is about more than the famous red colobus monkeys. With the right guide, it becomes:

- A gentle walk through different forest types.

- A chance to understand **mangroves, water and conservation** on the island.

- A natural pairing with the **south coast beaches** and small villages.

Add a late lunch and a sunset stop in the south and you have a full, quietly beautiful day.

## Matching experiences to different travellers

- **First-time visitors**  
  One Stone Town day, one ocean day (Safari Blue), one nature day (Spice + Jozani) is a perfect trio.

- **Families**  
  We slow things down: a half-day Stone Town, a lagoon-friendly ocean day and time on easy beaches like Paje or Jambiani.

- **Honeymooners**  
  Private or semi-private departures, late starts, sunset focus and quiet coves away from the busiest spots.

- **Frequent safari travellers**  
  We dial up **culture, food and walking**. Think backstreet Stone Town, local coffee houses, spice with cooking and quiet sandbanks.

When you reach out to Savana Blu, tell us **who you are travelling with and what feels like a perfect day**. We will suggest a handful of experiences that fit, instead of a long checklist you feel obliged to tick off.
