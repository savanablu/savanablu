One of the most common questions is how to divide time between safari and the coast. There is no single correct ratio. Different combinations suit different people, budgets and energy levels.



This note is not a rulebook. It is a simple framework you can apply to your own situation.



## A question of focus



Ask yourself two questions:



1. Which excites you more at this stage of life: wildlife days or saltwater days?

2. How much quiet and recovery do you need built into your trip?



Someone who is deeply drawn to wildlife may be content with more days in the bush and only a short, quiet spell by the sea. Someone else may want just a taste of safari and more time listening to waves.



## Common shapes people choose



Without treating these as packages, some broad shapes often appear:



- **Short safari, longer coast** – a few days of concentrated wildlife time followed by a week or more on the beach.

- **Balanced** – several days in each place, giving both aspects space.

- **Safari–led** – a longer stretch in different wildlife areas, with a short, calm coastal ending.



These are patterns, not promises, but they can help you think about what feels right.



## Consider the people, not just the places



Children, older travellers and people with particular health considerations may respond differently to early starts, temperature changes and long travel days.



It can be helpful to listen to each person's preferences and to leave enough space so that nobody feels pushed beyond what they can comfortably enjoy.



## Let flexibility sit alongside structure



Whatever shape you choose, leaving a little room to adjust — especially on the coastal side — makes it easier to respond to how everyone is actually feeling once you are travelling.



If you share how long you have in total, who is travelling and whether you lean more towards wildlife or the ocean, we can help you think through different ways of balancing bush and beach without overcommitting you to a rigid pattern.
