Zanzibar offers more than enough choice: dhow days on the water, reef snorkelling, sandbanks, Stone Town walks, spice farms and forest visits. The challenge is less "what is available?" and more "what will actually feel good for us?"



This note is not a promise of any specific itinerary. Instead, it is a calm way to think about your days so that the time you do spend here suits the people you are travelling with.



## Start with how you like to move



Some guests are energised by full, active days. Others are much happier with a single well-chosen outing and plenty of time by the pool, in a book or on a veranda.



It can help to ask each person in your party a few questions:



- Do you enjoy early starts or slower mornings?

- Do you love being in the sea, or prefer to dip in and out gently?

- Are you drawn more to history and markets, or to reefs and sandbanks?



Even simple answers will make it easier to choose experiences that feel natural rather than forced.



## Ocean days: dhows, reefs and sandbanks



Boat and reef days are often high on people's lists. There are many ways to spend time on the water — sailing in traditional dhows, snorkelling reefs, visiting sandbanks or simply being out on the sea.



If you are travelling with young children or anyone who is less confident in the water, you may want to focus on gentler spots, shorter snorkel sessions and areas with space to sit, watch and paddle, rather than constant activity.



## Town days: Stone Town, markets and spice



Stone Town can be fascinating and rich, but it can also feel hot and intense if you try to tick off every landmark in one outing. Many guests enjoy seeing only a few key streets and corners, then pausing in a shaded courtyard or café rather than chasing a list.



Spice visits can be light, sensory experiences when taken at an easy pace. They suit people who enjoy smells, tastes and stories more than large crowds.



## Forest and nature: colobus monkeys and mangroves



If you enjoy being outdoors but prefer shade and greenery to open beaches, forest areas and mangroves can offer a different side of the islands. Expect simple paths, wildlife in its own setting and a slower rhythm than a city excursion.



Again, try to think in terms of how long you enjoy being out, how much walking feels comfortable and whether any members of your group would appreciate frequent pauses.



## Leave room for nothing



One of the easiest mistakes is to fill every day with activity. Zanzibar rewards unhurried time just as much as organised visits. Leaving gaps in your schedule allows for simple pleasures: a swim when the light is kind, an unplanned walk on the sand or a quiet hour looking at the water.



If you share your dates, where you are staying and who you are travelling with, we can suggest a light mix of days — some on the water, some on land — that respects your pace rather than squeezing in as much as possible.
