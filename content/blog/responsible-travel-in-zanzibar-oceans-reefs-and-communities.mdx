Zanzibar's appeal rests on living things: coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, dolphins, fish and the communities whose lives are tied to the sea. Responsible travel here is less about rigid rules and more about a set of simple, respectful habits.



These notes are not a set of regulations, and they do not cover every situation, but they can help you make choices that contribute positively rather than causing quiet harm.



## Give wildlife space



It can be exciting to see dolphins, turtles or rays in the water. The most respectful encounters are often the calmest ones: boats moving slowly, engines used gently, and people avoiding sudden jumps or loud chasing.



If you find yourself in a situation where boats are crowding animals or cutting across their path repeatedly, it is reasonable to feel uncomfortable. A good starting point is to prefer operators and days where the focus is on watching rather than pursuing.



## Treat reefs as living places, not playgrounds



Coral is not just colourful stone. It is fragile, living structure. Standing on it, dragging fins or dropping anchors on it can cause damage that takes a long time to repair — if it recovers at all.



Simple habits help:



- Float above reefs rather than standing on them.

- Avoid touching coral, even if it looks solid.

- Keep fins clear of the reef when turning or adjusting equipment.



These are small actions, but repeated many times they make a difference.



## Choose gentle sunscreens and products



Some ingredients in common sunscreens can be harmful to marine life when washed into the sea. If it is practical, consider using reef–friendlier options, wearing a light rash–vest or timing your swims to avoid the harshest sun rather than relying solely on heavy creams.



It is not about perfection, just about making kinder choices where you can.



## Be thoughtful in villages and town streets



Many visits pass through fishing villages, small communities and older streets in Stone Town. These are real homes, not film sets. Respectful behaviour, modest clothing in more traditional areas and asking before taking close–up photographs all contribute to a better experience on both sides.



Purchasing local goods or food, when it feels natural to you, can also help money stay closer to the communities you are visiting.



## Ask questions and stay curious



Responsible travel is easier when communication is clear. It is always acceptable to ask how certain activities are run, what is done to reduce impact or why a particular day is recommended over another.



No single guest can change the entire industry, but each person can choose to travel in a way that feels thoughtful. If you would like to shape your time in Zanzibar around calmer, lower–impact experiences, you can mention this when you get in touch and we will keep it in mind when suggesting options.
