Zanzibar's beauty is not just in its beaches. It lives in its reefs, mangroves, coastal forests and communities. As visitor numbers grow, it matters how we travel.

Savana Blu is a small, locally connected operator, and many of our guides and crew live in the very villages we visit. Here are some quiet guidelines we share with our guests.

## In the ocean and on the reef

### Choose your fins and your feet carefully

When snorkelling:

- Keep **your fins off the coral** — even "dead-looking" coral may be alive.

- Use a lifejacket if you're not fully confident, so you float without needing to stand.

On Savana Blu departures, guides brief every guest before getting in the water and stay close enough to support nervous swimmers.

### Dolphin encounters, done gently

Dolphins near Mnemba and Kizimkazi are wild and free. They are not an attraction to be chased.

We:

- Avoid operators who box dolphins in with multiple boats.

- Time our departures to reduce pressure at peak hours.

- Keep a respectful distance, cutting engines if animals are clearly disturbed.

Seeing dolphins should feel like a privilege, not a guarantee.

## On the sandbanks and beaches

Sandbanks are fragile. We:

- Take ash and waste back to the main island — nothing is buried in the sand.

- Use reusable cups, plates and serving ware on Safari Blue days.

- Keep music low or off, so the experience belongs to **everyone on the water**, not just one boat.

As a guest, you can help by bringing a **reusable water bottle** and saying no to single-use plastics where possible.

## In villages and on cultural visits

Curiosity is welcome; intrusion is not. A few simple courtesies go a long way:

- Ask before taking photos of people, especially children.

- Dress with a little more coverage in villages and Stone Town than you might on the beach.

- Buy directly from **small stalls and cooperatives** where you can.

Savana Blu works with guides who live in the communities we visit, and we favour experiences that are co-created with local partners, not imposed on them.

## How Savana Blu puts this into practice

We are not perfect, but we are committed:

- We cap group sizes and prefer **small dhows and smaller buses**, even when this is less profitable.

- We plan itineraries around tides and crowds, not just convenience.

- We work with crew and guides who are paid fairly and regularly, not just on busy days.

When you choose Savana Blu, you are choosing an operator that cares about **how** you experience Zanzibar as much as **what** you see.

If responsible travel matters to you, mention this when you contact us and our team will suggest experiences, timings and small touches that align with those values.
