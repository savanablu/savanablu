Many travellers treat Stone Town as a one-night stop between flights and beaches. We think that's a shame.

With three nights in and around Stone Town, you can blend history, food, spice and sea in a way that feels quietly luxurious rather than rushed. Here's how we like to design it.

## Day 1: Arrive softly and meet the city

After arrival and check-in:

- Take a **gentle orientation walk** with one of our guides.

- Pause for sunset on a rooftop, watching the harbour and dhows.

- Try a relaxed dinner with Swahili dishes – think coconut, lime and local seafood.

We keep your first day light; there's no need to race through all the sights at once.

## Day 2: Heritage, markets and the water

Morning:

- A **deeper heritage walk**, threading through alleys, old merchant houses and courtyards.

- Visit the **market and fish section** while it's still busy and colourful.

- Stop for coffee or fresh juice in a tucked-away café.

Afternoon:

- Free time to explore shops and galleries, or simply wander with your camera.

- Optional **sunset dhow cruise** with light snacks and a hint of music.

This day is about understanding Stone Town's rhythm – the doors, the calls to prayer, the harbour.

## Day 3: Spice and the rural edge

We step outside the city:

- Morning at a **small, family-run spice farm**, learning how cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon appear in everyday life.

- Simple home-style lunch in the village.

- Optional visit to a **nearby beach or mangroves** for a change of scene.

You return to Stone Town in the late afternoon, in time for a final sunset drink and a last wander through the alleys.

## Who this suits

This slow three-day arc suits:

- Couples and honeymooners who like atmosphere and wandering.

- Curious travellers who enjoy food, architecture and stories.

- Safari guests looking for a **soft landing** before or after the bush.

If this sounds like your ideal arrival in Zanzibar, mention it when you contact Savana Blu. We'll adapt it around your flight times, interests and accommodation style – from heritage townhouses to contemporary boutique hotels with sea views.
