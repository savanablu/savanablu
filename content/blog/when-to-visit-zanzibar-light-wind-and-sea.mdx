Because Savana Blu is based in Zanzibar, we pay attention not only to the calendar but also to how the islands actually feel — light, wind, sea conditions and the general pace of life. This is a simple guide to what each period is usually like, rather than a set of promises for any specific day.



## December to February – Bright days and warm seas



This is often the classic "picture–postcard" view of Zanzibar. Days are typically hot, bright and dry, with strong light and warm water. Reefs and sandbanks can look especially vivid in this period.



It can also be one of the busier times of year, especially around festive holidays and school breaks. If you prefer quieter beaches, you may simply want to avoid the most popular days, rather than the whole season.



## March and April – Softer light, higher chance of rain



March can start warm and calm, gradually moving into the so–called "long rains". This does not mean it rains all day, every day. Showers may come and go, and some days remain open and beautiful, but you should be comfortable with the idea of occasional grey skies or storms.



Some guests like this period because prices on the islands can be gentler and there is more space almost everywhere. Others prefer to keep Zanzibar for a time of year when sunny days are more likely.



## May and June – Quiet and often green



Depending on the year, late May and June can feel like a green, quieter phase. Breezes are often cooler, light can be gentle and the islands take on a softer look. It may not be ideal if you are chasing guaranteed hot beach weather, but it can suit guests who like calm atmospheres, walks and slower days.



Operations and opening times for some businesses can vary in this period, so it is worth checking what is open in the area where you plan to stay.



## July to October – Dry, breezy and comfortable



Many visitors consider this one of the most comfortable stretches of the year. Days are often dry and sunny without being overwhelmingly hot. Breezes can keep the air moving and evenings may feel pleasantly cool, especially by the water.



This can be a good time for people who enjoy being outside for longer, exploring Stone Town, doing spice farm visits or combining time on the water with time on land.



## November – A short, changeable shoulder



November can bring the "short rains", but patterns shift from year to year. You might have clear days, showers or a mix of both. Sea conditions can also vary. It is a shoulder period, so flexibility and realistic expectations help.



## It's more about your preferences than a perfect month



There is no single "best" month to visit Zanzibar. Some people love the bright, busy holiday periods; others prefer quieter, more changeable times when the islands feel softer.



If you share when you are thinking of travelling, who is coming with you and what you enjoy — quiet beaches, markets, time in the sea or a mixture — we can offer suggestions that suit your preferences rather than aiming for a perfect forecast.
