Zanzibar is beautiful year-round, but it does **not** feel the same in April as it does in August.

Because Savana Blu is based in Zanzibar, we plan departures with more than just the calendar in mind – we watch light, wind, tides and sea conditions. Here's how the main periods feel from the ground.

## December – February: Dazzling light and warm seas

This is the classic "picture-postcard" season. Days are hot, dry and bright, with strong light and long beach days.

- Sea temperatures are usually around 28–30°C.
- Excellent time for snorkelling and sandbank days.
- Evenings are perfect for rooftop dinners in Stone Town.

If you prefer **calm seas and warmth**, this is one of the most reliable windows.

## March – May: Green season and soft skies

From late March, the **long rains** can arrive. The island becomes lush, frangipani trees explode into flower and the skies soften.

- Showers can be heavy, especially in April.
- Many larger beach hotels run maintenance.
- Boutique properties and Stone Town stays can be atmospheric and excellent value.

We do still operate, but we will plan your touring with more flexibility for showers and cloud.

## June – October: Trade winds and clear, fresh days

From June, the **kusi trade wind** brings fresher air and lower humidity. It is one of the best times to combine **safari and Zanzibar**.

- Clear, comfortable days – especially July to September.
- Lovely conditions for walking Stone Town and spice farms.
- Ocean experiences feel slightly wilder, with a welcome breeze on the dhow.

If you like to be active and outdoors without strong heat, this is your season.

## November shoulder: Short rains and moody skies

November often brings the **short rains** – brief showers that pass quickly.

- Light is beautiful for photography.
- Showers are usually short, with long dry spells.
- Sea is still warm and inviting.

This can be a wonderful time for travellers who enjoy **quieter beaches and softer colours**, especially couples and photographers.

## So, when *should* you come?

There is no single "best month" for everyone. Instead, we recommend you choose by **how you like to feel**:

- If you love warm, bright days and long evenings by the ocean – **January, February, August and September**.
- If you prefer cooler air and gentle breezes – **June and July**.
- If you enjoy atmosphere, value and softer skies – **November and parts of March**.

When you contact Savana Blu, tell us how you like to spend your days and we'll suggest **specific weeks and tides** that fit, rather than a generic month. That's the luxury of having a small, Zanzibar-based team watching the island every day.
